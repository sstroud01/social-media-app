# Reflection: Building Enhanced Social Feed with GitHub Copilot

## What did you ask Copilot to help you build?
I asked Copilot to help me build a social feed web application with features like posting, liking, deleting, emoji support, category filtering, and a modern UI. I requested improvements for a better grade and professional appearance.

## How did you break down the problem?
I started by outlining the basic structure (HTML, CSS, JS). Then, I added features step-by-step: post creation, category selection, emoji picker, like/delete buttons, filtering, theme toggle, and local storage. I asked Copilot for enhancements and best practices at each stage.

## How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
Initially, I asked for broad improvements. As I progressed, I focused on specific features and UI details, requesting targeted changes and clarifications. I learned to be more precise and iterative in my prompts.

## What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?
Copilot was able to generate entire components and handle complex logic, like local storage and emoji integration, with minimal input. The speed and accuracy of suggestions exceeded my expectations, especially for UI/UX improvements.

## What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?
I learned how to integrate third-party libraries (Emoji Button), use local storage for persistence, and implement responsive design and theme toggling efficiently. Copilot also taught me best practices for structuring code and handling user interactions.

## What would you do differently if you had to build this again?
I would plan the features in more detail before starting, use version control from the beginning, and document each step with screenshots. I would also explore more advanced frameworks or backend integration for scalability.
